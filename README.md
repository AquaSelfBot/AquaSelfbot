# React Selfbot
## Yes, for real

## ⚠ "Maintained" version: https://github.com/FlawCra/ReactSelfbot ⚠

### Why am I making this open source?
Because can't stop calling my product a rat, tokenlogger and what else not.

### But there is "skidded code"
I've got some dictionaries and code from Sherlock, because how am I supposed to implement Sherlock without adding code from it :WeirdChamp:

### Before someone says "it's pasted"
Every single selfbot is pasted and every discord.py command looks the same, now shut up

### Will this be the next Alucard?
Yes, definetly.

### How to compile/use?
I will release a compiled version. If you don't know how to compile it, don't.

### Can I skid this, I mean it's open source?
If you do, I will make sure everyone knows its from me :)

### Will you publish the Authentication/Dashboard/Website?
No I won't, because it's gonna make it easier for other pastes.

### You forgot something XXX is missing
I don't care.

### OS Support
The selfbot works on Windows, Linux (x64_x86/ARMv7) and should work on MacOS (Not tested)

# Licensing
I'm gonna put this under a license which won't allow other products to publish closed source variants of this, even though I know skids like Nighty, Ragnarok will still do it.
